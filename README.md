## Front End Developer Challenge (HTML & CSS)

Thank you for applying to hear.com as a Front End developer. We would like to get a general idea of your expertise and give you the chance to show us your skills.

This challenge will involve converting a visual design to HTML and CSS. In order to view and interact with the design, please create a [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) account.

**The challenge**

Please convert the following [Figma design](https://www.figma.com/file/5zbl0XzHHyi75zm3YqzPwv/Front-End-Coding-Challenge?node-id=0%3A1) to responsive HTML and CSS.
 * Please note that there are two versions of the page: 1) mobile and 2) desktop.

**Things to focus on**

 * Scalable and maintainable CSS.
 * Attention to design details.
 * Semantic HTML.
 * Accessibility.
 * Speed optimization.

**Tech Requirements**

- Please use vanilla CSS or SCSS. No Bootstrap or 3rd party CSS libraries and frameworks.
- The page should be responsive and should look good on all viewports and function correctly on all major browsers including Internet Explorer 11.
- Use a bundling tool like Webpack, Gulp, Parcel etc...
- An npm build command should build the entire page to a dist folder.

**Setting**

We expect you to invest about 4-6 hours for this challenge. We prefer quality over quantity. The level of feature completeness, documentation etc.. is subject to your decision making. Feel free to make any trade-offs and document your decisions. Think: product management is on vacation and not available.

**Deliverable**

Please provide us a link to a git repo with your source code and instructions on how to run the code. Make sure it works out of the box and briefly describe your solution and explicitly mention any trade-offs and simplifications. Put instructions and a description in a README file.
